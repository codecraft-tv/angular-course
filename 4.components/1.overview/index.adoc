= Overview

Components are the fundamental building block of Angular applications.

Components are _composable_, we can build larger Components from smaller ones.

An Angular application is therefore just a tree of such Components, when each Component renders, it recursively renders its children Components.

At the root of that tree is the top-level Component, the _root_ Component.

When we _bootstrap_ an Angular application we are telling the browser to render that top-level _root_ Component which renders its child Components and so on.

In this section we'll build upon the knowledge learned in the quickstart and cover:

* How to architect an application using Components.
* The Component decorator in more depth.
* Content Projection
* Component Lifecycle Hooks
* View Children vs. Content Children
