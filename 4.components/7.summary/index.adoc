= Wrapping Up

In this section we covered Components in much more detail than the quickstart.

We discussed how to architect your application using components in Angular. We explained one method of breaking down your applications design into components with clear responsibilities, inputs and outputs.

We covered some of of the ways we can configure a component via the `@Component` decorator, specifically the `templateUrl`, `styles`, `styleUrls` and `encapsulation` configuration properties.

We covered the mechanism of content projection in Angular with the `ng-content` tag.

We explained the various component lifecycle phases, when they are run and how to hook into them with functions on the component.

Finally, we covered the idea of view and content children and how to get references to each in a component.
