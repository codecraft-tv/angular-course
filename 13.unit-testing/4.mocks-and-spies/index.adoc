= Testing with Mocks & Spies

In this lecture we are going to discuss how to test classes which have dependencies in isolation by using _Mocks_.

== Learning Objectives

* How to _Mock_ with fake classes.
* How to _Mock_ by extending classes and overriding functions.
* How to _Mock_ by using a real instance and a _Spy_.

== Sample Code

Let's imagine we have a `LoginComponent` which works _with_ the `AuthService` we tested in the previous lecture, like so:

[source,typescript]
.login.component.ts
----
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {AuthService} from "./auth.service";

@Component({
  selector: 'app-login',
  template: `<a [hidden]="needsLogin()">Login</a>`
})
export class LoginComponent {

  constructor(private auth: AuthService) {
  }

  needsLogin() {
    return !this.auth.isAuthenticated();
  }
}
----

We inject the `AuthService` into the `LoginComponent` and the component shows a _Login_ button if the `AuthService` says the user isn't _authenticated_.

The `AuthService` is the same as the previous lecture:

[source,typescript]
.auth.service.ts
----
export class AuthService {
  isAuthenticated(): boolean {
    return !!localStorage.getItem('token');
  }
}
----

== Testing with the Real `AuthService`

We could test the `LoginComponent` by using a real instance of `AuthService` but if you remember to _trick_ `AuthService` into returning `true` for the `isAuthenticated` function we needed to setup some data via `localStorage`.

[source,typescript]
----
import {LoginComponent} from './login.component';
import {AuthService} from "./auth.service";

describe('Component: Login', () => {

  let component: LoginComponent;
  let service: AuthService;

  beforeEach(() => { # <1>
    service = new AuthService();
    component = new LoginComponent(service);
  });

  afterEach(() => { # <2>
    localStorage.removeItem('token');
    service = null;
    component = null;
  });


  it('needsLogin returns true when the user has not been authenticated', () => {
    expect(component.needsLogin()).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it('needsLogin returns false when the user has been authenticated', () => {
    localStorage.setItem('token', '12345'); # <3>
    expect(component.needsLogin()).toBeFalsy();
  });
});
----
<1> We create an instance of `AuthService` and inject it into out `LoginComponent` when we create it.
<2> We clean up data and localStorage after each test spec has been run.
<3> We setup some data in `localStorage` in order to get the behaviour we want from `AuthService`.

So in order to test `LoginComponent` we would need to know the _inner workings_ of `AuthService`.

That's not very _isolated_ but also not _too_ much to ask for in this scenario. However imagine if `LoginComponent` required a number of _other_ dependencies in order to run, we would need to know the inner workings of a number of other classes just to test our `LoginComponent`.

This results in _Tight Coupling_ and our tests being very _Brittle_, i.e. likely to break easily. For example if the `AuthService` changed _how_ it stored the token, from `localStorage` to `cookies` then the `LoginComponent` test would break since _it_ would still be setting the token via `localStorage`.

This is why we need to test classes in _isolation_, we just want to worry about `LoginComponent` and not about the myriad of other things `LoginComponent` depends on.

We achieve this by _Mocking_ our dependencies. Mocking is the act of creating something that looks like the dependency but is something _we_ control in our test. There are a few methods we can use to create mocks.

== Mocking with Fake Classes

We can create a fake `AuthService` called `MockedAuthService` which just returns whatever we want for our test.

We can even remove the `AuthService` import if we want, there really is no dependency on anything else. The  `LoginComponent` is tested in isolation:


[source,typescript]
----
import {LoginComponent} from './login.component';

class MockAuthService extends AuthService { # <1>
  authenticated = false;

  isAuthenticated() {
    return this.authenticated;
  }
}

describe('Component: Login', () => {

  let component: LoginComponent;
  let service: MockAuthService;

  beforeEach(() => { # <2>
    service = new MockAuthService();
    component = new LoginComponent(service);
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    service = null;
    component = null;
  });


  it('needsLogin returns true when the user has not been authenticated', () => {
    service.authenticated = false; # <3>
    expect(component.needsLogin()).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it('needsLogin returns false when the user has been authenticated', () => {
    service.authenticated = true; # <3>
    expect(component.needsLogin()).toBeFalsy();
  });
});
----
<1> We create a class called `MockAuthService` which has the same `isAuthenticated` function as the real `AuthService` class. The one difference is that we can control what `isAuthenticated` returns by setting the value of the `authenticated` property.
<2> We inject into our `LoginComponent` an instance of the `MockAuthService` instead of the real `AuthService`.
<3> In our tests we trigger the behaviour we want from the service by setting the `authenticated` property.

By using a fake `MockAuthService` we:

 * Don't depend on the real `AuthService`, in fact we don't even need to import it into our specs.
 * Make our code less brittle, if the inner workings of the real `AuthService` ever changes our tests will still be valid and still work.

== Mocking by Overriding Functions

Sometimes creating a complete fake copy of a real class can be complicated, time consuming and unnecessary.

We can instead simply extend the class and override one or more specific function in order to get them to return the test responses we need, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
class MockAuthService extends AuthService {
  authenticated = false;

  isAuthenticated() {
    return this.authenticated;
  }
}
----

In the above class `MockAuthService` _extends_  `AuthService`. It would have access to all the other functions and properties that exist on `AuthService` but only override the `isAuthenticated` function so we can easily control it's behaviour and isolate our `LoginComponent` test.

NOTE: The rest of the test suite using mocking via overriding functions is the same as the previous version with fake classes.

== Mocking with Spies

A _Spy_ is a feature of Jasmine which lets you take an existing class, function, or object and _mock_ it in such a way that you can control what gets returned from function calls.

Let's re-write our test to use a Spy on a real instance of `AuthService` instead, like so:


[source,typescript]
----
import {LoginComponent} from './login.component';
import {AuthService} from "./auth.service";

describe('Component: Login', () => {

  let component: LoginComponent;
  let service: AuthService;
  let spy: any;

  beforeEach(() => { # <1>
    service = new AuthService();
    component = new LoginComponent(service);
  });

  afterEach(() => { # <2>
    service = null;
    component = null;
  });


  it('needsLogin returns true when the user has not been authenticated', () => {
    spy = spyOn(service, 'isAuthenticated').and.returnValue(false); # <3>
    expect(component.needsLogin()).toBeTruthy();
    expect(service.isAuthenticated).toHaveBeenCalled(); # <4>

  });

  it('needsLogin returns false when the user has been authenticated', () => {
    spy = spyOn(service, 'isAuthenticated').and.returnValue(true);
    expect(component.needsLogin()).toBeFalsy();
    expect(service.isAuthenticated).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
----
<1> We create a real instance of `AuthService` and inject it into the `LoginComponent`.
<2> In our teardown function there is no need to delete the token from `localStorage`.
<3> We create a _spy_ on our `service` so that if the `isAuthenticated` function is called it returns `false`.
<4> We can even check to see if the `isAuthenticated` function was called.

By using the spy feature of Jasmine we can make any function return anything we want:

[source,typescript]
----
spyOn(service, 'isAuthenticated').and.returnValue(false);
----

In our example above we make the `isAuthenticated` function return `false` or true in each test spec according to our needs.

== Summary

Testing with real instances of dependencies causes our test code to know about the inner workings of other classes resulting in tight coupling and brittle code.

The goal is to test pieces of code in isolation without needing to know about the inner workings of their dependencies.

We do this by creating Mocks; we can create Mocks using fake classes, extending existing classes or by using real instances of classes but taking control of them with Spies.
