= Const

`const` is a new keyword which declares a variable as _constant over time_.

== Declaring a `const` Variable

We can use `const` to declare a variable but unlike `let` and `var` it must be _immediately_ initialised, with a value that can’t be changed afterwards.

If we try to declare it without initialising it we get a `SyntaxError`, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
const foo; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
----

If we try to change it after we have declared and initialised it we get a `TypeError`, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
const foo = 1;
foo = 2; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
----

== Block Scoping

Both `let` and `const` create variables that are block-scoped – they only exist within the innermost block that surrounds them.

[source,javascript]
----
function func() {
    if (true) {
        const tmp = 123;
    }
    console.log(tmp); // Uncaught ReferenceError: tmp is not defined
}
func();
----

== Immutable Variable

Variables created by `let` and `var` are _mutable_:

[source,javascript]
----
let foo = "foo";
foo = "moo";
console.log(foo);
----

TIP: _Mutable_ in this case means _can change over time_.

Variables created by `const` however are _immutable_, they don't change over time, specifically the const variable can't _point to_ another thing later on.

[source,javascript]
----
const foo = 'abc';
foo = 'def'; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
----

== Mutable Value

There is one big pitfall with `const` however.

When we say "`const` variables are immutable" it only means that the variable always has to _point to_ the same thing. It does not mean than the _thing_ it points to can't change over time.

For example, if the variable `foo` is a `const` that points to an object - we can't make `foo` point to another object later on:

[source,javascript]
----
const foo = {};
foo = {}; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
----

But we can however _mutate_, make changes to, the object `foo` points to, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
const foo = {};
foo['prop'] = "Moo"; // This works!
console.log(foo); 
----

If we want the _value_ of `foo` to be immutable we have to freeze it using `Object.freeze(...)`. 

When we freeze an object we can't change it, we can't add properties or change the values of properties, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
const foo = Object.freeze({});
foo.prop = 123;
console.log(foo.prop) // undefined
----

However by default the above doesn't throw an error, it just _silently_ ignores the issue. So in the example above it didn't throw an error when we tried to set `foo.prop = 123` but when we try to print out the value on the next line we just get `undefined`.

To force `Object.freeze(...)` to throw an error we must remember to be in `&quot;use strict&quot;` mode, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
"use strict";
const foo = Object.freeze({});
foo.prop = 123; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'foo' has already been declared
----

== Summary

`const` lets us declare variables which don't change over time, which are immutable.

The important _gotcha_ with const is that the variable is immutable, but not the value, the thing the variable points to.

This means that if we declare an object as `const`, confusingly we can still change properties of the object later on.

To solve this and make an object immutable we use the `Object.freeze(...)` function which together with the `&quot;use strict&quot;;` param throws an error if we try to change the object.
