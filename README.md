# Angular from Theory to Practice

This is the official repository for the Angular course on https://angular.codecraft.tv

- Each folder is a chapter in the book, ordered by prefix number.
- Each chapter has a subfolder for each lecture, again ordered by prefix number.
- Each lecture has an `index.adoc` file which contains the content for that lecture.
- Each lecture folder may also contain `code` and `images` folders which contain any code or images needed to support that lecture.

## Contributions

Any contributions you make to this effort are greatly appreciated, from a typo to a code change.

Contributors added to the `CONTRIBUTORS.adoc` will be added to the published book on Amazon the next time it's released (changes are not pushed in real-time to Amazon).
